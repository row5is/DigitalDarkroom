// In a remap transform, the pixels are simply moved around in the buffer, mostly.  We precompute
// these moves, and store the distance the pixel moves.  The move may not be more than 2^32 Pixel
// addresses.  Some of the destination pixels are simply set to a particular color, shown here:

enum SpecialRemaps {
    Remap_White = -1,
    Remap_Red = -2,
    Remap_Green = -3,
    Remap_Blue = -4,
    Remap_Black = -5,
    Remap_Yellow = -6,
    Remap_Unset = -7,
};

// Since these are stored where we keep distances:

typedef long RemapDist;      // separation in the array of the remap

// We make all these specials negative, and add a bias to make all the moves
// positive.  The keeps testing and moving quite fast.
