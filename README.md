This is an iOS app that is a reboot of a very old science museum exhibit,
the Digital Darkroom, which first appeared in the Liberty Science Center
when it opened in the early 1990s.

The exhibit featured very early work by Gerard Holtzman at Bell Labs,
and predated such programs as Photoshop.  The first version snapped a
picture, and then the user could perform a series of video transforms
and even (in the early version) print out the results.

Around 2000, I reimplemented this program on live video streams: the
new Pentiums had a huge amount of compute power, and the frame rates were
generally acceptable, even though a variety of transforms were performed
on each frame.  As far as I know, that exhibit is still at the Liberty Science
Center, but it has been a while since I have been in touch with them.

So, why recreate the program as an app? Video transforms like those Gerard pioneered
are in dozens of common video programs.  

To the best of my knowledge, none of the current programs allow one to
stack a series of transforms on a moving image. For my money, this was
the best part of the original exhibit: one could spend half an hour on a
quiet day exploring variations.  I think this is one of the hallmarks 
of the best hands-on exhibits.

So I am bringing this all back to life in an iOS app (I am an Apple fan boy).
It will include Gerard's original transforms, a number from other people
at the Labs, and gathering many new ones from various sources.  

Gerard's original work used a language, Pico, to program the transforms. I
have never figured out how to include that bit in the exhibit.
